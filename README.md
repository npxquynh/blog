This is my blog where I am trying to note down things that are useful to me technically. And some random things.

## How to add new entry

```
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```

## Commit entry into the master branch

## Generate static page from the Markdown file

Running this script will generate the static pages for the whole sites. And then push all the change into branch `gh-pages`. Which is the branch I use for displaying content in [my blog at github](npxquynh.github.io/blog)

```
sh publish_to_ghpages.sh
```
